/**< \brief Basic JAZZ types and definitions.

	This file has things as all the declarations. There are too many method declared to be implemented in a single file. jazzCommond.cpp  only
implements trivial constructors/destructors + root methods of start()/stop()/reload() + Some cluster configuration parsing. The rest are implemented
in the appropriate source files in: jzzMISCUTILS, jzzALLOC, jzzCONFIG, jzzACCESS, jzzTHREADS, jzzLOGGER and jzzHTTP.

/** Data types of BLOCKS

	All block types supported by Jazz (See the description on each type and the notes here for details.)

	NOTES:
	------

	\b Binary \b compatibility: When said to be binary compatible, it only means allocation independent data. Specifically, it is compatible with
	the result of R's serialize(*, NULL) excluding the trailing 14 bytes.
	For example, a LGLSXP x would be returned by R's serialize(x, NULL) as:
	X	 \n		|- format version 2 -|	|- writer = R 3.2.5 -|	|- min read R 2.3.0 -|	|-	 LGLSXP == 10	-|	...
	0x58, 0x0a, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x02, 0x00, 0x03, 0x02, 0x05, 0x00, 0x02, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0a, ...
	will be stored as:
	|-	 LGLSXP == 10	-|	...
	0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0a, ...
	The Simple types (LGLSXP, INTSXP, REALSXP, RAWSXP) are straightforward. Simply add the trailing constant 14 bytes, unserialize() and you have
	an R object.
	In the case of STRSXP, The R object is a SEXP followed by a block of pointers (SEXPs pointing to CHARSXPs). What we store are the strings,
	and not the pointers, obviously.

	\b Factors and \b grades: The blocks contain integers only as INTSXP, just like a BLOCKTYPE_INTEGER and treated internally the same. At mesh
	level, some attributes define labels corresponding to each value. The values should be correlative starting at 0 and can be later converted
	into R factors combined with their labels. The only difference between them is BLOCKTYPE_GRADE is sorted and BLOCKTYPE_FACTOR unsorted, for
	whoever that makes sense (plots, regressions, etc.).

	\b Instrumental \b types: Are the types in [BLOCKTYPE_C_BOOL..BLOCKTYPE_C_R_REAL] that may be part of instruments. All other types only support
	block level.

	\b Mime \b types: All types will be returned with mime type "application/octet-stream", except BLOCKTYPE_RAW_MIME_* that will be returned with
	a specific mime type.

	\b Strings: Strings are stored as a BLOCKTYPE_C_OFFS_CHARS, NOT compatible with R. It is more efficient in two ways (storage, because strings
	are reused, a block of 50K NAs is stored in one byte (a single zero) a block of 50K with a cardinality of 10 can be stored in tenths of bytes)
	and more importantly, the offset part of a BLOCKTYPE_C_OFFS_CHARS is a vector of integer and can be applied filtering, union, etc. without the
	need to scan it. An R block of strings is not persisted, just is returned via jzzROM, created on demand to create an R vector of character by
	just calling unserialize() over it.

	\b Time: Time is store in double a Unix time (also known as POSIX time or Epoch time) is a system for describing instants in time, defined as
	the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970, not counting leap seconds.

	\b System \b blocks: Are blocks that are persisted in the SYS source. BLOCKTYPE_ALL_* are identical in all nodes and are forced to be written
	by the foreman with no other writing mechanism. BLOCKTYPE_MY_* are written by each tode to itself and usually are logging events, security
	events and profiling statistics.
